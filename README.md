High Performance Model Based Image Reconstruction for Parallel-beam Computed Tomography

Optimized for Intel multi-core processors

## Requirements:

Intel C compiler (icc)

## Instructions:
The command line follows the OpenMBIR project (https://github.com/cabouman/OpenMBIR). The "demos" from that project can be retrieved and run on this project after minor edits to the shell scripts.
